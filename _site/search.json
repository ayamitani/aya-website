I\r\ndevelop statistical methods and tools to answer oral health questions\r\narising from complex multilevel data.\r\nBiased\r\nsampling designs in complex surveys and observational studies\r\nTo study the relationship between a disease and its risk factors, we\r\ncollect information from a sample of individuals. This sample, ideally,\r\nshould represent the population that we want to study. But when time and\r\nmoney are limited, the sample size must be small. To make meaningful\r\ninference about every person in the target study population, we need to\r\npurposefully oversample people from under-represented groups and correct\r\nfor the sampling bias using proper statistical methods. I study the\r\nimplications of using biased sampling designs under special\r\ncircumstances.\r\nMultiple imputation for\r\nmissing data\r\nMultiple imputation (MI) is a common approach to handle missing data\r\nin observational and experimental studies. MI is straightforward to\r\nimplement with cross-sectional data with no derived variables, such as\r\ninteraction terms. But if I want to include an interaction effect in the\r\nanalysis, and if one or both variables that make up the interaction are\r\nmissing, how do I impute them? Do I impute the original variables and\r\ncompute the interaction variable or do we impute the interaction\r\ndirectly? What if I have clustered or longitudinal data with missing\r\noutcomes? How do I incorporate the correlation between observations in\r\nthe imputation model? These are the questions I try to answer.\r\nModeling agreement in\r\ncancer screening\r\nRadiologists read mammograms to screen for breast cancer but how\r\nconsistent are the results between two radiologists, or three?\r\nTraditional agreement statistics – like Cohen’s Kappa – lack the ability\r\nto measure agreement between many radiologists each reading many\r\nmammograms. A generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM) can be used\r\nto compute a comprehensive summary measure of agreement (and association\r\nif the screening result is an ordinal score) between many radiologists’\r\nmammogram readings. I also authored an R package modelkappa\r\nto calculate GLMM-based agreement and association.\r\nSelected publications\r\nA complete list of my published works is available from my Google\r\nscholar page.\r\nMitani AA, Kaye EK, Nelson KP.
