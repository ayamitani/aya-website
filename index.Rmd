## **Bio**

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/division/biostatistics/) at the [Dalla Lana School of Public Health](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. 
  
My research has focused on developing statistical methods to analyze correlated data and to remove biases that emerge from informative cluster size, study design, missing data, or misclassification in multilevel observational studies and complex surveys. I have collaborated with researchers from various disciplines including oncology, nephrology, anesthesiology, and oral health.
  
If you are a student and interested in working with me, please contact me by email at aya.mitani(at)utoronto.ca.
